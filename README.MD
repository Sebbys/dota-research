# Revision Checklist: Random Forest Final Draft

Here is a to-do list to guide the revision of your paper.

## Section 1: Model-Centric Tuning

- [X] Explain the rationale for a model-centric tuning approach.
- [X] Detail how different representations of "heroes" and "items" were used and why this is important for the model.

## Section 2: Foundational Concepts
### Machine Learning 
- [X] Reinforcement Learning Explanations
### Hyperparameter Theory

- [X] Explain `min_samples_split`: what it is and how it prevents overfitting.
- [X] Explain `max_depth`: its role in controlling tree complexity and the bias-variance tradeoff.
- [X] Explain other relevant hyperparameters used in your model.

### Machine Learning Overview

- [X] Define and differentiate between Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement Learning.
- [X] Clarify that Random Forest is a Supervised Learning algorithm.

### Random Forest Explained

- [X] Provide a clear, step-by-step breakdown of how the Random Forest algorithm works, from bootstrapping to final prediction.

### Formula Explanations

- [X] Explain the formula for Gini Impurity or Information Gain, and its role in splitting nodes.
- [X] Include the formula for how the final prediction is aggregated from individual trees.

## Section 4: Experimentation and Metrics

### Performance Metrics

- [X] Define the "Accuracy" metric.
- [X] Discuss why accuracy was chosen as the evaluation metric for this project.

### Hyperparameter Tuning

- [X] Present the hyperparameter search space in a two-column table format (Parameter | Values/Range).
- [X] Describe the Random Search methodology and explain why it was used for hyperparameter tuning.
