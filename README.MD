# Revision Checklist: Random Forest Final Draft

Here is a to-do list to guide the revision of your paper.

## Section 1: Model-Centric Tuning

- [ ] Explain the rationale for a model-centric tuning approach.
- [ ] Detail how different representations of "heroes" and "items" were used and why this is important for the model.

## Section 2: Foundational Concepts
### Machine Learning 
- [ ] Reinforcement Learning Explanations
### Hyperparameter Theory

- [ ] Explain `min_samples_split`: what it is and how it prevents overfitting.
- [ ] Explain `max_depth`: its role in controlling tree complexity and the bias-variance tradeoff.
- [ ] Explain other relevant hyperparameters used in your model.

### Machine Learning Overview

- [ ] Define and differentiate between Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement Learning.
- [ ] Clarify that Random Forest is a Supervised Learning algorithm.

### Random Forest Explained

- [ ] Provide a clear, step-by-step breakdown of how the Random Forest algorithm works, from bootstrapping to final prediction.

### Formula Explanations

- [ ] Explain the formula for Gini Impurity or Information Gain, and its role in splitting nodes.
- [ ] Include the formula for how the final prediction is aggregated from individual trees.

## Section 4: Experimentation and Metrics

### Performance Metrics

- [ ] Define the "Accuracy" metric.
- [ ] Discuss why accuracy was chosen as the evaluation metric for this project.

### Hyperparameter Tuning

- [ ] Present the hyperparameter search space in a two-column table format (Parameter | Values/Range).
- [ ] Describe the Random Search methodology and explain why it was used for hyperparameter tuning.
